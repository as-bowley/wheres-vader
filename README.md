# Where's Vader?

## Description

This project was made for The Odin Project's curriculum, focusing on gaining familiarity with Firebase and also learning about the implementation of a backend in to a React project. The project is made in the style of a Where's Waldo/Wally? game, where you need to find certain characters in a larger image. The coordinates and also the leaderboard for the game are all kept on a Firestore database.

Some improvements that I would make to this project would be:

- adding multiple levels and a variety of characters to find, rather than the static level and characters to locate.
- use the useReducer hook rather than multiple switch statements when managing the state of guesses.
